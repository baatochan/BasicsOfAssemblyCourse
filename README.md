# Basics of Assembly Course
AT&T Assembly code written during Basics of Assembly course (Architektura Komputerów 2) at the university.

Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

Course Instructor: dr inż. (PhD) Tadeusz Tomczak

This repo contains 6 folders where every single of them corresponds to single labs.

Run files are explanation how to compile single program/task.

You have to run Linux on Intel x86 device and have `gcc` and `stdlib` installed (I needed to install `gcc-multilib`) to compile this code. The code will not work under Windows Subsystem for Linux as it can't deal with 32-bit assembly.

I tried to provide task description for every labs in `README` files.

The code is in Polish and English (mixed).
